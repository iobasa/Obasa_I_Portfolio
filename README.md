# Obasa_I_Portfolio
 a responsive one-page application to showcase an interactive implementation of infographic design.


## Assignment Description
The portfolio site you develop this term is ultimately what you will use to present your work and
your skillset (as designers and/or developers) to potential clients and employers. As such, the
design and presentation of that design is up to you entirely, within the technical parameters
listed below. Your final portfolio site will incorporate your logo and build upon the
interface/branding designs you develop in Electronic Image and Production.
Even though the design and technical aspects of the site may develop and change over your
last term, this site should represent the basis of the site that you will have as your final portfolio.
As discussed in class, you are required to buy both a domain name and Web hosting and put
your site live for it to be graded.

## Description
A portfolio site that will feature a home page and portfolio page which will display the work that I have done.
